## Goal

We have two models of childhood growth. They are trained to predict body composition (fat mass/lean mass distribution), throughout growth. They are also capable of determining the energy intake and expenditure related to a certain gain or loss in fat mass and lean mass. The goal of the models is twofold:

* To predict the body composition of a child given a certain energy intake. It requires more energy to deposit fat mass than lean mass.

* To predict the energy that must have been absorbed in order to reach a certain body composition. Lean mass has a considerably higher metabolic rate than fat mass, so a leaner child will need to consume more energy to maintain his/her weight and grow. 

* We are particularly interested in the first two years of growth, and optimistically we would like information from birth to six months.

There is some brevity in the preceeding discussion, for instance we can initiate a birthweight, change caloric intake over time, etc. I don't think I've left out any relevant model details, but correct me if I'm wrong.

## Now the Statistical Challenge

We have World Health Organization (WHO) data that includes weight for each age, and intake for each age. The weight data is divided by "standard deviations" from the "mean". If we cause the models to follow the 0SD ("mean") weight trajectory (which we can do), and compare the model outputs for energy intake to see which model is closest to the mean intake trajectory, to what degree can we conclude which model works best, and what strategies are necessary to make the best conclusion? 

There are several reasons for the quotes around standard deviation and mean:
For anyone interested in some very disciplined and sophisticated dataset construction, visit http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/technical_report/en/ and begin with the introduction. This dataset is derived from a combination of longitudinal and cross-sectional data, for which there is a detailed protocol to apply weighting. The 0SD is a "mean" value, but it is derived from an age-transformation power based on examining changes in global deviance. This along with some technical details resulted in a smoothed and fitted model, which was subsequently subjected to a rigorous skewing adjustment method involving what's called a Box-Cox transform power. The result is a dataset with something that resembles a mean and values corresponding to something they call standard deviations, but that is nothing like any classically derived distribution, and is several layers removed from our intuition regarding binning and probability, means, and the rest. 
Here is a sample of the weight data, all masses are in kilograms.

## Analysis

My hapless attempt to understand this procedure follows.

We can't find reliable data for both body composition and energy intake that is subject specific, and has the power we will need for young ages. One reason is that reliable methods for estimating fat and lean mass in an individual involve X-rays, and are almost never applied to children under eight for fear of harm from the X-rays. Let's find out if in general, the 50th percentile or mean for weight can be used to predict the median or mean lean body mass of a child. The reason this might be helpful is because energy expenditure is governed primarily by body composition, since lean mass requires more energy to maintain than fat mass. If we wish to make a prediction of energy expenditure based on weight, then we must be able to predict lean mass, or equvalently, body composition, based on weight.

We will load some data from the CDC. We will choose 8 year olds to control for age because that's the lowest age we have subject-specific data for. We will ignore the gender to improve our power, because until puberty the growth trajectories are similar.

```
Now we have a subset of data with `r num` eight year old subjects. We would like to know if there is a correlation between weight and lean mass in order to determine if weight is a good predictor.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(plyr)
library(gdata)
library(e1071)
all_data_cors<-as.matrix(all_data8)
cor(all_data_cors)
```

There appears to be an extremely high correlation between weight and lean mass. Therefore, we can predict lean mass by knowing weight with a great degree of certainty. Therefore, we can predict with some certainty energy intake given a value for weight. The crucial question, however, is; to what extent can we conclude that a subject with average bodyweight will have average lean mass? 

We will calculate the means for each measurement, and then see if the subjects are the same. Let's first sort the dataset by weight so we know we are looking for around the 80th subject.

```{r}
weight <- all_data8[order(all_data8$dxdtotot),]
meanweight<-mean(weight$dxdtotot)
meanlean<-mean(weight$dxdtoli)
which(abs(all_data8$dxdtoli-meanlean)==min(abs(all_data8$dxdtoli-meanlean)))
which(abs(all_data8$dxdtotot-meanweight)==min(abs(all_data8$dxdtotot-meanweight)))
```

We seem to be off by thirteen subjects. The subject closest to the mean weight is lighter than thirteen subjects who have less than average lean mass. Thirteen subjects who have less than average lean mass are heavier than the average weight subject. 

It's fairly apparent why the weight subject is close to the 80th, and also why he is not the actual 80th. If the distributions were normal, then the 0SD would be equal to the 50th percentile (and in some other more peculiar situations). Since the WHO data are arranged by SD instead of quantiles, we might assume that the 0SD best describes the mean, but what if we were wrong, and the WHO 0SD is more like the 50th percentile, after all the diagnostics? 

The median weight will have to be the 80th subject, right? Let's also see if by chance our medians are lining up, since we might wonder if the WHO data is better described as centered around the median value.

```{r}
#lean <- all_data[order(all_data$dxdtotot),] 
which(weight$dxdtoli==median(weight$dxdtoli))
which(weight$dxdtotot==median(weight$dxdtotot))
head(weight)
```

Unfortunately, not only is the median weight the 80th subject, but the subject with the median lean mass is nowhere near the weight of the subject with the median weight. Even worse, unlike the comparison of means, where the child closest to the mean lean mass was heavier than the child closest to the mean weight, now the child with the median lean mass is much $\textit{lighter}$ than the child with the median weight. 

Let's take a look at the distributions.

```{r}
#hist(all_data8$dxdtotot, breaks=40, main=("Histogram of weights"),freq=FALSE)
#lines(density(all_data8$dxdtotot))
#hist(all_data8$dxdtoli, breaks=40, main=("Histogram of lean masses"),freq=FALSE)
#lines(density(all_data8$dxdtoli))


a=all_data8$dxdtotot
b=all_data8$dxdtoli
p<-hist(a, xlim=c(0,60), ylim=c(0,.1), col="red",breaks=30,freq=FALSE)
lines(density(all_data8$dxdtotot))
hist(b, add=T, col=rgb(0, 1, 0, 0.5),breaks=30, freq=FALSE)
lines(density(all_data8$dxdtoli))
```

We can see that the distributions are not normal. We would have expected them to be somewhat skewed, simply because the values are bounded from below. What we see is that they are not $\textit{similarly skewed}$. We can measure the degree to which a distribution is skewed in R...

```{r}

skewness(all_data8$dxdtotot) 
skewness(all_data8$dxdtoli) 

```

...and we can understand the meaning of these values, but are there solid tools to use these measurements to inform our model comparison?

Maybe we got unlucky with the 8 year olds, let's try 9 year olds.
```{r}
all_data9<-all_data[which(all_data$ridageyr<10 & all_data$ridageyr>8),]
#hist(all_data9$dxdtotot, breaks=40, main=("Histogram of weights"),freq=FALSE)

#lines(density(all_data9$dxdtotot))
#hist(all_data9$dxdtoli, breaks=40, main=("Histogram of lean masses"),freq=FALSE)

#lines(density(all_data9$dxdtoli))
a=all_data9$dxdtotot
b=all_data9$dxdtoli
p<-hist(a, xlim=c(0,60), ylim=c(0,.1),col="red",breaks=30,freq=FALSE)
lines(density(all_data9$dxdtotot))
hist(b, add=T, col=rgb(0, 1, 0, 0.5),breaks=30, freq=FALSE)
lines(density(all_data9$dxdtoli))
```

Again, of course the values are different, but the distributions are also different. 
```{r}
skewness(all_data9$dxdtotot) 
skewness(all_data9$dxdtoli) 
sd(all_data9$dxdtotot)
sd(all_data9$dxdtoli)
quantile(all_data9$dxdtotot)
quantile(all_data9$dxdtoli)

```

The 9 year olds show the same trend, the lean masses are more normally disributed than the weights. This makes sense if one imagines a cohort of eight or nine year olds.

```{r}
weight9 <- all_data9[order(all_data9$dxdtotot),]
meanweight9<-mean(weight9$dxdtotot)
meanlean9<-mean(weight9$dxdtoli)
which(abs(all_data9$dxdtoli-meanlean)==min(abs(all_data9$dxdtoli-meanlean)))
which(abs(all_data9$dxdtotot-meanweight)==min(abs(all_data9$dxdtotot-meanweight)))
```



```{r}
#lean <- all_data[order(all_data$dxdtotot),] 
whichmedian <- function(x) which.min(abs(x - median(x)))
whichmedian(weight9$dxdtoli)
whichmedian(weight9$dxdtotot)
head(weight9)
```

The row numbers are closer this time, but they are in agreement with eight year olds: The subject with the mean lean mass will have lower than average weight. Although, for nine year olds, the trend is not reversed for medians. The child with the median lean mass will still have lower than average weight.

So, there is mounting evidence to suggest that if a subject has a mean bodyweight, he will $\textbf{not}$ have a mean lean mass.

It would be a big deal if the WHO data turned out to be normally distributed, because since we are analyzing CDC data from much later in life, it seems reasonable that data from earlier in life might be distributed differently. We understand that normally distributed data have standard deviations that are (absolutely) equal for values equally greater than or less than the mean. We are interested in this instance in comparing the skewness of the data.
